            Here is all the documentation for assignment 4

			Here's my code<br>
			The premise of this circuit is to monitor the resistance of a photoresistor and output analog power relative<br>
			to the sensor reading to an LED light strip

			The circuit schematic. I decided to use 10K resistors to limit the current flowing between the arduino and transistor. 
			this will keep the current below the arduinos threshold.  5v/ 10000ohms = .0002 amps  <br>
			A 1k resistor was used for the sensor circuit. 5v / 1000ohms = .002 amps
