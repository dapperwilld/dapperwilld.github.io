            <p>My Final Project is titled Headlights! here is the documentation	</p>
			<p>
			Here is a picture of the circuit<br>
			The circuit is two an LEDs in series with a 330k resistor along with a <br>
			photoresistant sensor circuit. The circuit is mounted on a pair of sunglasses <br>

			The circuit schematic. 
			I used 2 red LEDs with voltage drop of 1.8v<br>
			The resistor keeps the LEDs below their current threshold of 20mA<br>
			5 - 1.8 = 3.2 / 330 = .009 A
			</p>

			<p>
			Here's my code<br>
			The circuit takes an input value from the photoresistor circuit<br>
			does some math with it and spits out an out put value that scales with how dark<br>
			the ambient light is.
